# CornGame
Corn Maze game written in rust with the bevy engine

## TODO:
- :x: update code to bevy 0.12.1
- :x: rewrite corn rendering code to be better and support shadows
- :x: clean up and document rendering code
- :x: actual game logic
## FUTURE TASKS: 
- :x: Find a solution for different parts of the corn being rendered differently
- :x: allow different corn fields to be rendered with different materials
- :x: allow different lod levels to be rendered with different materials
- :x: Custom shadow mapping algorithm? maybe
- :x: Some sort of extreme distance billboarding technique
- :x: Some sort of extreme shell texturing technique for really far away corn
- :x: Some sort of skybox limit texture to render an  infinite corn field effect
