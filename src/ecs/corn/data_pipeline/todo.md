## Corn Data Pipeline TODO:
- Both Operation Manager and Operation Executor are heavily reliant on Resources, It would be a good idea to try and seperate these tasks from resources and turn them into Entities. This would also allow for an easy conversion to having multiple `InstanceBuffer`'s. Multiple buffers would allow for some really easy occlusion culling and LOD grouping, as well as reduce memory cost, as one single buffer means that every piece of corn needs to be in GPU memory all the time, even if its not even close to being rendered.
- Operation Executor has some really iritating code that I'm still not happy with. The entire thing is long and complex as there are numerous things to manage in order to execute the buffer operations every frame. Some thought and research should be put toward finding a simpler, and nicer solution to the problem.
- Operation Executor needs to have some timing and profiling code added in order to get detailed information on the cost of buffer initialization and management
